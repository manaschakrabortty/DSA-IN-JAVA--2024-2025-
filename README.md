DSA Practice in Java - 2024

  --> Welcome to my Daily DSA Practice repository! This is my ongoing journey through Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using Java, where I solve problems daily, 
refine my problem-solving skills, and maintain a consistent study schedule.

Repository Structure

  Each folder is organized by topics, including:

Arrays and Strings

Linked Lists

Trees and Graphs

Stacks and Queues

Dynamic Programming

Sorting and Searching

Recursion and Backtracking

Goals

 1. Daily Practice: I aim to solve at least one DSA problem daily.
  
2.  Pattern Recognition: Focus on identifying problem patterns and efficient solutions.
  
  3. Optimization: Improve solution time and space complexity where possible.
